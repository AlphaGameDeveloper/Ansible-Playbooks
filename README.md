# Ansible-Playbooks
These are some of the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks I use to automate my homelab.  If you want to use them, knock yourself out! *(although they might suck lol)*

## Macbook Setup & Configuration
I have an Ansible playbook that sets up and configures my mac, based on Jeff Geerling's ([@geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy)) Mac Development playbook repo.  It can be found [here](https://github.com/AlphaGameDeveloper/Mac-Development-Playbook)

It's not in this repo because it's large and I want to be able to get commits from the upstream repo.
